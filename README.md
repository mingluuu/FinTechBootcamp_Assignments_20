# Smart Contract with Solidity

**Overview**

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, this Solidity smart contract accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. This smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
